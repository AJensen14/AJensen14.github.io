    <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
    <h3>Why did I decide to make this?</h3>
    <p>As a final year PhD student I will do literally anything other than write my thesis and therefore decided to teach myself HTML,
        GitHub pages and also a little bit of markdown. I'm hoping that one day this website will be used to advertise myself a little bit better
        but for now it is purely for procrastination and as a learning exercise. 
    </p>
    <h3>What will be available on this website?</h3>
    <p>I plan to include some information about me, links to some social things, some projects I have worked on, all of my boring work and maybe some more stuff if I can think of what to put.</p>
    <h3>Messing about</h3>
    <p>I wanna learn how to put images onto a webpage, so hopefully here's a penguin.</p>
    <img src = "penguin.png" alt = "A penguin">
    <!-- Image Section -->
