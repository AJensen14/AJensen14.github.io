4. Add a password onto the website to be viewed
5. Contact page
   1. LinkedIN
   2. Knowhow
6. Then edit those pages to make this website visible on them

## *Design*
No idea how to design things or even go about structuring website
Ideally want an about me page to begin with then with links to other stuff
- [] About me
- [] Data analysis portfolio
- [] Links to publications
- [] Useful videos
- [] Running pbs

In order to make this i need to first find a design and begin learning how to edit panels at the top 
I can do this in shiny apps but not sure how to do this
